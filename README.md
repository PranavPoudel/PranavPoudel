IT undergraduate focused on systems, backend development, and infrastructure.

Most of my work is hands-on — building labs, breaking environments, and rebuilding them to understand how things work at a low level. I’m particularly interested in Linux systems, networking, self-hosting, and backend architecture.

## Focus Areas

* Backend development & APIs
* Linux system administration
* Networking & infrastructure
* Homelab & self-hosting
* PXE booting / clustering
* Systems & security labs (CTFs)

## Tech I Work With

* Linux (Debian/Arch-based)
* Bash / Shell scripting
* C / Low-level programming
* Node.js / Backend tooling
* Git & automation workflows

GitHub is where I document experiments, lab builds, and projects as I learn — not just finished products, but the process behind them.
